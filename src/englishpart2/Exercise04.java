 * The following pseudocode has been arrived at for a program that converts pounds to kilos (1 kilo = 2.2 lb):
 * BEGIN
 * PROMPT for value in pounds
 * ENTER value in pounds
 * SET value to old value รท 2.2
 * DISPLAY value in kilos
 * END
 * Implement this program, remembering to declare any variables that are necessary.
